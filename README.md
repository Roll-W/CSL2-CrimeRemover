# Crime Remover

This is a mod for `Cities: Skylines 2` that removes crime from your city.

But you could also make your city a "Vice City" through the mod settings.

This mod should works well with new or existing save games and be safe to
remove from the game without any side effects.

If you have any problems during using this mod, please open an issue or discussion
on Github.
